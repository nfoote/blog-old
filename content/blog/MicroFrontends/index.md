Micro front-ends provide advantages when building an application.

- Splitting the areas of the application into isolated componenets allowing teams of developers to work on their own product without impacting other teams
- Deploying of each area of the application can be also be done in isolation, allowing for features and bug fixes to be done without deployment of the entire application
- The entire application can become framework agnostic, meaning teams are free to use whatever framework they like.
